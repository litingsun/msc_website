## Individualized Assistive Device for Rehabilitation and Augmentation


<!-- Add your own introduction here -->

### <a name="id1"></a>Introduction

It is important to develop assistive devices suited to usersf abilities since there are individual differences in terms of muscle strength, and similarly, people with disability have different levels of residual strengths. We focus on design and control of individualized assistive devices for augmentation and rehabilitation, which enable users to increase muscle strength, work space of upper limbs, and other important factors to improve Activities of Daily Life (ADL). A collaborator are researchers from the lab of Professor Ruzena Bajcsy at UC Berkeley working on individualized human modeling. We are currently interested in 1) development of assistive devices with actuators except for electrical geared motors, and 2) control methods based on userfs motion intention estimated from EMG and other human modeling parameters.
