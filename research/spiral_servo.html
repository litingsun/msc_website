<h3 id="audio">Overview</h3>
<p>Servowriting is a manufacturing process where the data tracks and servo
sectors are defined on the disk platters by creating the servo patterns so that
the HDD servo system can later use them to identify the tracks and servo
sectors, and to measure the relative position of the read head to the track
centerline, i.e., the Position Error Signal (PES). The HDD servomechanism
generates the position feedback signal by using the servo patterns as
reference, which are written on the disks when no reference is present on the
disks or inside the HDD. There are several conventional mechanisms used to
provide the reference while the servo writing is performed. The common one is
to externally write the position (servo burst) and timing (synchronization
mark) information onto the disk surface by means of a costly laser-guided
push-pin mechanism which can accurately move the HDD actuator arm so that the
write head is positioned on the desired tracks.</p>
<p>To obtain adequate servo pattern quality is the key to achieve high TPI
(track per inch) of the hard disk drive products, thus improvement of the servo
track writer performance becomes increasingly important. As the TPI gets higher
and higher, servo writing takes a longer and longer time. This requires
additional investment on servo track writer which translate to increase of the
product cost. One way to solve the problem is to write spirals on the servo
track writer and perform in-drive fill later in the self test chamber. The
latter process is called self servo writing. Since spiral writes takes much
shorter time on servo write, this greatly reduces the servo track writing time,
thus the servo track writer cost.</p>
<p>To reduce the disturbance and to improve the servo accuracy, robust and high
precision learning control algorithms have been developed for single and
multiple spiral writing.</p>
